# mini-projects
Experimental and learning mini projects.

## 7-days of JS projects challenge
I took this challenge where I had to write a small Vanilla JS project every day. These projects focus on functionality first. After each project I collected my thoughts about what I have learned doing them and what is to improve on them in the future.
