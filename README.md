Experimental and learning mini projects.

## 7-days of JS projects challenge
I took this challenge where I had to write a small Vanilla JS project every day. These projects focus on functionality first. After each project I collected my thoughts about what I have learned doing them and what is to improve on them in the future.

Many of the project ideas come from the great Vanilla JS champion, Chris Ferdinandi (https://learnvanillajs.com/projects/).

* Day 1: bin2dec ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/bin2dec/))
  * An app that convert binary numbers to decimal.
* Day 2: progress-bar ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/progress-bar/))
  * A form that dinamically updates a progress bar as the user progresses filling it out.
* Day 3: border-radius ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/border-radius/))
  * A tool to visualize the CSS border-radius properties and to generate CSS as an output both in long and shorthand form.
* Day 4: temperature ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/temperature/))
  * An app to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Americans always scare me with their weird temperatures!
* Day 5: randomizer ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/randomizer/))
  * An app that can gather list items and pick one from them "randomly".
* Day 6: toggle-tabs ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/toggle-tabs/))
  * A demo of a general script that can turn a list into a toggle tab navbar.
* Day 7: github-repos ([demo](https://bukazoltan.github.io/mini-projects/github-repos/))
  * A little experimental API project, listing all my github repos.
