# github-repos
A simple app that lists my github repos. It uses unathenticated API calls, thus it is limited for 60 calls/hour from an IP.

## What I've learned/practiced
* JavaScript
  * How to handle data coming from promises.
  * Better understanding of fetch error handling.
  * How to build out more complex nodes using dynamic data and add them to the DOM.

## What to improve
